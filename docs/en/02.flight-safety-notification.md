### Key Functions Development

To ensure that DJI can provide a comprehensive maintenance service for your DJI aircract and DJI Dock, as well as to analyze aircraft incidents and determine liability, DJI strongly recommmends completing the development of the following key features before using the "Cloud API" for cloud-based development:

* [Remote Log](https://developer.dji.com/doc/cloud-api-tutorial/en/feature-set/dock-feature-set/remote-log.html)

* [Firmware Upgrade](https://developer.dji.com/doc/cloud-api-tutorial/en/feature-set/dock-feature-set/firmware-upgrade.html)

* [HMS Function](https://developer.dji.com/doc/cloud-api-tutorial/en/feature-set/dock-feature-set/hms.html)

* [Remote Debugging](https://developer.dji.com/doc/cloud-api-tutorial/en/feature-set/dock-feature-set/remote-debug.html)

* [Locate Last Known Position](https://developer.dji.com/doc/cloud-api-tutorial/en/server-api-reference/mqtt/thing-model/gateway/dock/device.html): Issue a task to request the device to report the aircraft's latitude and longitude parameter in osd properties, and upload it to could servers using the Dock or the remote controller.

* [Record Task Plan Library History](https://developer.dji.com/doc/cloud-api-tutorial/en/api-reference/dock-to-cloud/mqtt/dock/dock1/wayline.html): After Issuing a task, developers can record associated records in a database.

### Firmware Upgrade

To ensure stable operation of DJI Dock and DJI aircraft and reduce the occurrence of incidents, DJI strongly recommends encouraging your customers to upgrade to the latest firmware whenever new firmware versions are released.

To check for the latest firmware version, taking DJI Dock and Matrice 30/30T as examples:

* Visit the product downloads page of [DJI Dock](https://enterprise.dji.com/dock/downloads) and open the "release note" PDF file to look up for the latest firmware version. You can download the corresponding firmware package from the product downloads page of [DJI Dock](https://enterprise.dji.com/dock/downloads).

* Visit the product downloads page of [Matrice 30/30T](https://enterprise.dji.com/cn/matrice-30/downloads) and open the "release note" PDF file to look up for the latest firmware version. You can download the corresponding firmware package from the product downloads page of [Matrice 30/30T](https://enterprise.dji.com/cn/matrice-30/downloads).
