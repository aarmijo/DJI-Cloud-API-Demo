## Functional Overview

Remote debugging is to achieve unattended operation in the debugging process, that is, the operator can issue commands to the device on the cloud without going to the site to perform remote troubleshooting of the device. Remote debugging commands can be divided into commands (cmd) and tasks (job). Command (cmd) generally refers to the behavior that the device can reply to immediately after the command is issued, and the task (job) is the behavior that the device needs to continue to act on after the task is issued.


### Remote Debug Instruction
The command to be sent is specified by the "method" field in the 'Send Control Command' protocol transmitted between the cloud and the device. For the detailed protocol content, please view it in the 'Cloud API ' according to the 'Interface Detailed Implementation'.

|command(cmd)|task(job)|
|:---:|:---:|
|Debug mode on/off <br/> Fill light on/off <br/> 4G image transmission function on/off <br/> One key return|Dock restart <br/> Aircraft power on/off <br/> One Key Troubleshooting (One Key Takeoff Self-Check) <br/> Aircraft Data Format <br/> Dock Data Format <br/> Open/Close Canopy <br/> Pusher Expand/Close <br/> Charge Open /close <br/> |

### Task (job) Execution Process
After the task (job) is issued, the device will return to the execution state. The status is defined in the "status" field of the transport protocol.
The status is listed as follows:
* issued
* in progress
* Executed successfully
* pause
* rejected
* failure
* Cancellation or termination
* timeout

The execution flow is as follows:
