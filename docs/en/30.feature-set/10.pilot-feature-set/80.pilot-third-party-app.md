## Overview

For business scenarios that cannot be met by using DJI Pilot 2, developers can develop a lightweight App to be used together with Pilot2, such as intercom, special task commands, work orders, etc. In this way, users can directly open the third-party App through the Webview page of DJI Pilot 2. While developer only needs to automatically invoke the JsBridge interface to wake up the third-party App when opening the WebView page. The detailed configuration can be found at the link.
